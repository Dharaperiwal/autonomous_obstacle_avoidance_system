# Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance System for Mini UAVs

## Overview

This project implements an Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance System for Mini UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) using MATLAB. The system utilizes the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) approach for path planning and has been further optimized with the RRT* algorithm to improve path efficiency and minimize costs.

## Features

- **RRT Path Planning:** Implements the basic RRT algorithm to generate feasible paths in a complex environment.
- **RRT* Optimization:** Enhances the RRT approach by refining paths for better efficiency and shorter travel distances.
- **MATLAB Implementation:** Entirely developed in MATLAB, leveraging its powerful computational and visualization capabilities.
